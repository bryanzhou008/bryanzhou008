## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at UCLA, co-advised by Nanyun Peng and Kai-Wei Chang. I work on Multimodality (Vision + Language) and Embodied Learning. I'm also a research scientist intern at Meta FAIR Perception. Prior to my PhD, I was a visiting researcher at Stanford SVL, working with Jiajun Wu and Fei-Fei Li.
